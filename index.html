          <p>Mister Rogers arrives with a wooden puzzle where specific shapes must be matched to their corresponding holes. After playing with the puzzle for a moment, Mister Rogers sings You've Got to Do It.
<br/> <br/>

Mr. McFeely stops by with a coin bank before he and Mister Rogers visit Negri's Music Shop where a collection of toy banks is on display.
<br/> <br/>
In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, King Friday plans to purchase a record player for the Neighborhood school but he becomes distracted when a curious delivery is made to Corney's factory.
<br/> <br/>
King Friday learns that Corney is manufacturing some "things" for Southwood and orders Handyman Negri to buy one of the parts from Corney for further inspection. Handyman Negri questions the high cost of the item but Corney says that the people of Southwood have been willing to pay that price.
<br/> <br/>
Prince Tuesday returns from school where he has been learning about countries and wars. When he asks King Friday if there has ever been a war in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, his father assures him that for generations there has been nothing but peace in the Neighborhood. King Friday recalls a song which his forefathers had taught him about solving problems and sings a small portion of the song (the song is exactly the same as Many Ways to Say I Love You but the words have been changed to "many ways to solve a problem"). With war fresh on their minds, King Friday and Prince Tuesday begin to wonder if the pieces being made for Southwood are bomb parts.
<br/> <br/>
Back at the house, Mister Rogers sings a line from King Friday's song before he plays a game by dropping coins onto a piece of paper with shapes drawn on it. Lastly, Mister Rogers shows a film called "Food Drop" which shows food being dropped from a military aircraft.</p>

He says that a person’s imagination is more wonderful than the computer. In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, King Friday and Queen Sara are looking for the royal mouse; King Friday tells Mayor Maggie that she may begin searching for the mouse. Mayor Maggie is not sure what the royal mouse looks like, and she decides to ask Henrietta to help her since Henrietta is a pussycat. Mr. Aber arrives with a box of ‘clickers’ for the Mayor and suggests that maybe the royal mouse is a computer mouse. He and the Mayor decide to look for the mouse in different places. Lady Elaine hears ‘noise’ and comes out; Mr. Aber tells her what has been going on, and Lady Elaine calls the royal mouse “H.M.” and “Hula Mouse” and says that the mouse is safe. Back in Mister Rogers’ house Mr. McFeely arrives with a video called ‘How to Reconstruct a Computer Mouse.’ As he and Mister Rogers watch the video, Mr. McFeely explains the procedure. Mr. McFeely and Mister Rogers go to the computer room and Mr. McFeely navigates the Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood website. Mr. McFeely then says he has a ‘surprise funny fast’ film to show to Mister Rogers; the film is ‘Mr. McFeely Mowing the Lawn Quickly.’</p>

      <h1> ABOUT </h1>
      <p>The "Conflict" arc in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, a five-episode series from the 14th season, directly addresses the concept of conflict and war, particularly in response to the heightened tensions of the Cold War era. The arc, debuting in November 1983, uses the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to explore how misunderstandings and assumptions can escalate into conflict, even without physical violence. </p>

      <br/> <br/>

      <p>Due to the sensitive nature of the topic and concerns about the potential impact on young viewers, the "Conflict" episodes were removed from regular rotation and TV. </p>
